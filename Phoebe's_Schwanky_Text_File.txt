Instead of having a separate txt or csv file, I found that I liked having the list out in front of me;
and me being who I am, I didn't think a list of less than 20 things needed a separate txt file. Should
the list get long enough, I'd probably make it into a csv file


Time: I fiddled with a few different list formats and made a few different lists to see which ones I like most, 
and while I spent a good amount of time on it, I can't say I spent much more than about six hours on this.

Organization: here's a list of the functions I'm planning on using (this might change over time):
-print_og_list: this will print the list as it is before we make any changes
-new_task: this will append a string to the end of the list and print the list with the appended item
-no_more_task: this will remove a string from the list and print the updated list
-sort_them_all: this will sort the items, then print the list now that it's been organized

Progress: I've got the basic flow of interacting with this to-do list down. I'd say I'm about a third of the way there!

Description: 
-I haven't fleshed out my test code yet, but I'm planning on primarily using assert functions.
-I reread this week and Week 3's preparation information, as well as some help articles written by 
W3Schools, TutorialsPoint, and Python Docs. Next on my list is rereading Week 4's preparation information 
and going over Github and Python's documentation so I can be sure I have a handle on what I'm doing.
