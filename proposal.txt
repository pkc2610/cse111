CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program? Phoebe's Schwanky To-Do List

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve? I want a to-do list that I've made myself!

3. What will you learn from developing this program? I want to get more comfortable working with csv files.

4. What Python modules will your program use? py, csv, and maybe txt if I feel like really stretching out what I can do with a to-do list

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)
